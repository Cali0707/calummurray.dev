  excerpt: `Itâ€™s my pleasure to announce that the CloudEvents community has released version 1.0
of the CloudEvents SQL (CESQL) specification, along with implementations into SDKs for both Golang
and Java. This is a result of 3 years of work in the CloudEvents community, and builds on top of the
already released CloudEvents v1.0 specification, making it easier for developers to generate and
manage events flowing through their infrastructure.`,
