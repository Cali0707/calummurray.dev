Welcome back to this introductory blog series! In this article we are going to be providing an introduction to open
source: what it is, why you should care, and how you can participate. If you already have lots of open source
experience, you should be able to completely skip this post and jump to the next one, where we will go over how to set
up your development environment for working on Knative. But if you're new to open source, interested in learning more,
or want a refresher, then we look forward to discussing the what, why, and how of open source with you!
